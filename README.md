### PyBer_Analysis
##### Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to analyze ride sharing data and create visualizations to help understand the differences between the data in each kind of city.
The data was split between three city types. The three types of cities were rural, suburban, and urban. This particular analysis looking deeply into the data from the first four months of the year.
##### Results:
When you look at the data and multiple line graph you can see that urban areas have a larger amount of fares consistently. This could be due to having more people in the area to service. The number of rides in urban areas is almost 1,000 people more than the next area type. The prices for these areas don't increase either they are also on average the cheapers rides.

Overall when you are looking at the differences between the three city types as the sizes get bigger so do the number of drivers and the prices. There is never a point where each of these areas intersect and are all almost completly separate.

#####Summary
One recommendation that I can give the ceo is to give incentives to riders in rural areas. They have the lowest number of total rides but the highest price on average. In order to get prices down and increase riders offering benefits for riding in low volume areas could increase number of rides. Another recommendation is to offer some incentives for urban drivers to work in suburban areas. There are too many drivers in urban areas and not enough in suburban areas. Some of these places may be close enough that they can have some of the urban area drivers work in the suburban area in order to lower costs. The final recommendation would be to give first time riders a deal. It always good to drive in nre business.
